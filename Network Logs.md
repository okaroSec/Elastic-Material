## Network Logs and Threat Detection

Network logs play a critical role in cybersecurity by capturing all network activities, including connections, queries, and transactions. Analyzing these logs helps us identify unauthorized access, malware propagation, and data exfiltration. Let's dive into key aspects:

### 1. Identifying Suspicious Network Traffic Patterns

- **Event ID 1 (Process Creation)**: Provides details about newly created processes, including command lines and hashes. This information helps identify suspicious applications.
- **Event ID 3 (Network Connection)**: Logs TCP/UDP connections, revealing external communications and potential command and control (C&C) server interactions.
- **Event ID 22 (DNS Query)**: Captures DNS queries made by processes, essential for detecting initial domain lookups by potentially malicious software.

### 2. Analyzing DNS Queries

DNS queries offer insights into network behavior. Malicious applications often initiate DNS queries to connect with their C&C servers. For this analysis, focus on the following ELK query field:

- `winlog.event_data.QueryName`: Captures domain names queried by applications, crucial for identifying potential malicious domains contacted by malware.

### 3. ELK Query Deep Dive

#### Verifying Software Integrity

When assessing the legitimacy of an installed application, verify the integrity of its installation file. Use the following ELK query components:

- `winlog.event_data.OriginalFileName: "AnyProgram.exe"`: Narrow logs to those related to the "AnyProgram" executable.
- `winlog.event_data.Hashes`: Examine this field to retrieve the SHA256 hash of the executable for integrity verification.

#### Detecting Initial Communication Attempts

To understand an application's initial network behavior post-installation, focus on:

- `winlog.event_data.Image`: Isolate DNS queries explicitly made by the application, providing insights into its initial network communications.

## Example Query

```bash
winlog.event_data.Image:*filename* and winlog.event_id: 22
```

Using this query, check for DNS queries with the field:

```bash
winlog.event_data.QueryName
```
